In this project, I was able to create a simple guess my number game using basic DOM's Manipulation (JavaScript, CSS, and HTML).
This project helped me with experimenting with JavaScript classes and components. Mostly selecting index classes (document.queryselecter) in JavaSScript to add functions and storing working data from users' guess. I have added basic CSS properties to whenever the number th computer generates from random class, the background will appear to 'cold' or 'hot' depending on the respective number that is being guessed. I've also added background color manipulations when users guess the correct number. I've also added a basic state change when users press again button for another round, but will keep the highest guess score count. Another state change is when users reset the game for new scores.

Gameplay -

Guess my number! - Is the number you input closer or farther from the correct number! See if you can get the highest score!
